Title: The City That Remembers — Simple Version

Short summary
This story happens in a special city called Orison. In this city, promises are not just words. Promises become real, living things that can help or cause trouble. You are a beginner “Signer,” a person who understands and fixes promises. You will solve problems, speak with strange beings, and decide what kind of city Orison should become.

Why this story is good for learning
- People, places, items, and promises are like characters with clear roles. This helps you learn how to think in terms of parts that work together.
- You can start with a small part of the story and slowly add more. The story grows in steps, just like learning.

The world
- The city is built on special stone that keeps memories. Long ago, people wrote their rules into this stone. These rules became living promises.
- Parts of the city:
  - Scriptorium Ward: Where promise-keepers work and store important papers.
  - Latticeworks: A place of many bridges and towers that can move.
  - Low Echoes: Caves under the city where memories feel like air, and people made from shared memories live.
  - Glass Canals: Shiny water that sometimes shows possible futures.
  - Iron Orchard: Old metal factories now filled with clockwork trees that hold information in “fruit.”
- Magical beings:
  - Arbiters: Spirits who watch promises, make sure they are kept, and decide what the words mean.
  - Veil-keepers: Beings that witness promises so they count as true.

Groups in the city
- Scribes’ Conclave: Keep records and fix promises. They protect a special first promise called the Charter Seed.
- Waywrights: Builders who can talk to the city so it moves itself.
- Mariners’ Syndicate: Control water travel and use the canal reflections to guess possible futures.
- Echo-Folk: People made from many shared memories. Some want them to have full rights. Others say they are not real people.
- Quiet Court: A secret group that wants to break the power of promises so people cannot be forced by old rules.

Main characters
- You: A new Signer. You care about people and patterns but you are new to the job. Some of your own memories are unclear.
- Elara Voss: Your teacher. Kind but worried. She once used a very risky kind of promise to save lives.
- Cyric Vale: A clever builder who treats buildings like living pets.
- Mira: Leader from the Low Echoes. Strong, careful, and good at making deals.
- Archon Severin: Leader in the Quiet Court. He thinks people should be free even if that means promises stop having power.
- The Prime Witness: The first and oldest Arbiter. It wants to keep the city stable, even if that sometimes hurts people.
- The River: The spirit of the canals. It tells the truth but in puzzles.

Important things
- Charter Seed: The first promise that started the whole city system.
- Mnemonic Ink: Special ink that sinks into stone and makes promises “alive.”
- Meta-Oaths: Promises about how other promises work. Very powerful and dangerous.
- Witness Marks: Small objects (like coins or knots) that prove a promise exists.

Season 1 — The Broken Promise
- Problem: A deal between the Scribes and the Mariners fails. The canals turn black. Food trade stops. The city is in danger.
- What happens:
  1) You check the broken deal. A proof token is silent, and a spirit refuses to appear.
  2) You ask the River. It shows you a page with a line crossed out in special ink. That should be impossible.
  3) In the Low Echoes, Mira says her people are disappearing. Some proof tokens feel too strong near the caves.
  4) In Elara’s vault, you find a note: “Some promises can only be rewritten, not broken.” Someone tried to rewrite the deal.
  5) You talk to a spirit that speaks through shaking streetlights. It wants a story in trade. You give it a memory from your own life.
  6) You learn the Mariners had a secret extra deal with the Quiet Court. The two deals fight each other.
- Your choice: Restore the public deal and reveal the secret one, or accept the secret deal to keep food moving. Either choice makes enemies.
- Ending: You create a new version of the promise and clear the canals. The oldest spirit is watching you. The River whispers, “Your name is not your first.”

Season 2 — Masks of Many Names
- Problem: Many people carry fake proof tokens. Trust in the city is falling apart.
- What happens:
  1) A theater group sells pretend tokens. One pretend token sings like a real one near the Iron Orchard.
  2) The clockwork trees store old promises. Someone is making fakes from old pieces.
  3) Cyric makes the bridges move to answer questions.
  4) An Echo-Folk youth is blamed for selling fakes. Mira defends them and says Echo-Folk can hold true promises.
  5) You meet a person made from many memories who looks like your younger self.
  6) At a fancy boat party, you reveal that the Quiet Court is spreading fakes to see which parts of the city will collapse.
- Climax: You prove a promise is true without a token, by asking a whole district to witness together.
- Ending: The fakes burn away. Trust is hurt but not dead. You gain enemies and new fans.

Season 3 — The Family of Bridges
- Problem: A long family line controls moving bridges through old inheritance promises. A hidden child from the Low Echoes also has a claim.
- What happens:
  1) A will names the hidden child. The old promises say they are “not a person.”
  2) You see that the family promises include special rights like small mix-and-match add-ons.
  3) You argue that a person who can do the job should have rights, even without blood ties.
  4) A main bridge refuses to turn until the child is recognized.
  5) Severin offers to cut all blood promises in the city at once. Elara warns that many things could fall apart.
- Climax: You write a new rule: family gives basic rights, skill gives control. The child passes the skill test. The bridge turns.
- Ending: The city starts using skill-based charters. Severin is quietly pleased—you saved the system he plans to undo later.

Season 4 — The Rules of the Spirits
- Problem: The promise spirits (Arbiters) start acting strangely—some too strict, some too soft. The Quiet Court may have touched the first promise.
- What happens:
  1) You study how these spirits are “made.”
  2) You find Elara once added a hidden “mercy” note to many new promises to save lives.
  3) The Quiet Court adds a hidden “strictness” note in important areas.
  4) You argue the city should choose which note to follow based on context.
  5) The oldest spirit admits it always adds “keep things the same” to every spirit.
- Climax: You make a rule: spirits must show their hidden notes (mercy, strictness, stability) and choose which one to follow openly in each area.
- Ending: The spirits calm down. The Quiet Court runs away with a piece of the first promise.

Season 5 — The Flood of Unfinished Promises
- Problem: Many half-written promises spill into the canals. People forget parts of their lives.
- What happens:
  1) The River floods the city with broken sentences.
  2) You and Mira open a place where people can fix their promises.
  3) You must help many people at once, carefully.
  4) The place becomes messy and angry. The Mariners try to sell faster help.
  5) Severin’s agents steal valuable promises to sell later.
- Climax: You create a “Promise Loom,” a public ceremony where many trained helpers repair promises at the same time.
- Ending: People remember enough to continue. Some choose to leave certain old bonds behind.

Season 6 — The Unbinding and the Choice
- Problem: Severin shows his final plan: make promises optional so people are totally free.
- What happens:
  1) You finally see the Charter Seed, the first promise.
  2) Public talks split the city. Is freedom more important than stability?
  3) The oldest spirit begs you to keep the city steady.
  4) The founders’ voices admit they built the city in fear and too quickly.
  5) You write a last, big promise with two parts: 
     - People can choose to leave some promises if the community reviews and agrees.
     - All promises must be visible to everyone, with clear costs to leave.
- Finale: Severin’s pure freedom fails. Your balanced plan wins. Echo-Folk are fully recognized. The city accepts less control for more honesty.
- Epilogue: Elara gives you a blank page called “Promissory Futures.” The city waits for your next promise.

How to start small (for the first version of the game)
- Use one area: Scriptorium Ward and one dock.
- One main problem: The broken promise (Season 1).
- 4–6 scenes: check the deal, talk at the dock, visit the caves, speak to a spirit, reveal the secret, make a decision.
- Few characters: you, Elara, Cyric, one spirit, one Syndicate officer, a quick visit with Mira.
- Simple items: proof tokens, notes, and a basic ceremony to join two ideas into one new promise.
- Easy to grow later: add more districts, groups, and new kinds of promises.

Main ideas and images
- Promises as living things. Kindness vs. strict rules. Privacy vs. open truth. Who are you: your memories, or your choices?
- Pictures in your mind: humming tokens, mirrors on water, bridges that answer questions by turning, ink that will not dry on lies.

Future stories and add-ons
- Side stories: A token that learned to sing. A tax rule that forgave itself. A house that refuses to be pushed away.
- New groups: Hearthkeepers (home promises), Freehands (do not trust promises), Ledgerless (live without records).
- New systems: Markets where people trade stories, promise auctions, quiet courtrooms under theaters.

Character details (short)
- Elara Voss: Saved many during a sickness by adding “mercy” to rules. Afraid of making a big mistake again.
- Cyric Vale: Fixes machines and rules alike. Sees patterns but sometimes misses feelings.
- Mira: Protects her people. Finds the safest path that still reaches the goal.
- Archon Severin: Wants a world of choice. Accepts harm now for freedom later.
- Prime Witness: Cares most about stability. Does not understand joy.
- The River: Loves puzzles. Wants the city to be brave.

Places (short)
- Scriptorium Vault: Doors open when you admit guilt.
- Iron Orchard: Fruit show pictures of truth when cut.
- Low Echoes: You can get lost inside someone else’s childhood.
- Latticeworks: Bridges gossip by turning.
- Glass Canals: Nights are bright; water shows advice and takes a memory as payment.

Ending idea
The city is not perfect, but honest. You are not its ruler—you are its promise-writer. New seasons can happen in Orison or in other cities that copied Orison’s living promises.
